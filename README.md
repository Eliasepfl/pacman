# pacman

Hello, 

So this is my Pacman project I did in a duo with a student and good friend Eliot Ullmo.
This game consists of 3 levels from easy to difficult.

We tried to make the game a little spicier by making some extensions : 
- Adding noises for taking coins, losing, winning
- Adding a TAB menu
- Designing a new ghost with custom sprite and some special powers (but he appears rarely because he's strong)
- Adding portals to create new dynamic to avoid the ghosts
- Designing new walls, changing colors everytime you start a new game.

(Done with Eclipse in Java with OpenJDK 11.0.3)
